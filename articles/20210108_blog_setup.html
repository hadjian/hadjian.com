              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>
                  Hello Internet! This is the first entry of my blog. I
                  am a software engineer working for Siemens Technology
                  in Germany. I mostly work on IoT related projects in
                  different industrial branches like smart
                  infrastructure, manufacturing, energy, healthcare
                  etc. You can find out more about me on my
                  <a href="../about.html">about</a> page.
              </p>

              <p>
                  I mostly do backend stuff with golang in my
                  professional life and feel comfortable automating
                  stuff with Linux. Nowadays it's almost impossible to
                  evade web technology, as most desktop applications
                  have disappeared.
              </p>

              <p>
                  While the upper layers like JavaScript frameworks make
                  me run away, there is still a lot of interesting tech
                  involved, which I'd like to learn about. A great
                  colleague and web-wizard pointed me to
                  <a href="https://mzl.la/35lm3ts">Mozilla Web Docs</a>,
                  which struck me as one of the most beautifully written
                  piece of technical documentation ever conceived.
              </p>

              <p>
                  As nobody has ever learned anything, without getting
                  their hands dirty, I decided to hand-write HTML / CSS
                  for this blog, to see how far this approach can take
                  me (probably not that far, as the plethora of static
                  site generators, CSS frameworks and worry-free hosting
                  providers don't exist for nothing).
              </p>

              <h3>Domain and Web Server</h3>
              <p>
                  I reserved www.hadjian.com and www.hadjian.de ages ago
                  from a German hosting provider and never cared to put
                  something up. I was able to SSH into the server and
                  checked the settings of <code>sshd_config</code>. To
                  my surprise, all users including <code>root</code> were
                  allowed to login via password! Can you spell
                  d-i-c-t-i-o-n-a-r-y a-t-t-a-c-k?
              </p>
              <p>
                  Since this is the internet we're talking about, I
                  checked the frequency of login attempts by hackers or
                  script kiddies (see output below, snipped for sanity).

                  Who is <b>gary</b> and why was he trying to break into
                  my server? Luckily <code>lastb</code> shows
                  failed attempts. When I ran <code>last</code> it only
                  showed my own logins, although a good hacker would
                  have wiped that probably. So roughly 5-6 attempts per
                  minute. Hmmm...

              <h3>Adding (slightly more) Security</h3>
              <p>
                  First things first:

                      <code>

                      </code>
                  </pre>
              </div>
              <p>
                  After updating all the packages, I modified <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf</code> to

                  <ul>
                      <li>dissallow root login,</li>
                      <li>only allow a specific group to login and</li>
                      <li>only allow key-based login / disabling password login</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Before that, I added my user to the login group,
                  created an SSH key with <code>ssh-keygen</code> on my
                  local machine and copied over the public key to
                  <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Then I restarted
                  <code>sshd</code>. Now I should be the only one being
                  able to login.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Next, I checked running processes:

                  Nothing worrying to my understanding, excpet maybe the
                  <code>xinted</code> and <code>saslauthd</code> daemons.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Why is that installed? <code>xinetd</code> is a
                  super-server, which invokes others, in case their port
                  is connected to. Trying to deinstall it should list
                  dependent packages and tell me, if there is something
                  I might need. It didn't list anything dependent, so I
                  deleted it.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <code>saslauthd</code> had some dependencies however,
                  which don't seem necessary for my purposes:

                  I was not going to use my webserver as a mailserver
                  and all of those packages have to do with mail. Also I
                  was going to use nginx instead of apache, so all of
                  that could go away, if it was installed. Now I have a
                  list of running processes, I am familiar with and
                  which are required for webserver operations.

                  SSH, nginx and named have ports open, which seems
                  ok. With the minimum of proccesses running, a minimum

              <h3>Hand-Crafted HTML/CSS</h3>
              <p>
                  Nowadays it probably doesn't make sense to run your
                  own server and hand-write HTML / CSS. We have medium,
                  worpress and similar things and even going one level
                  below the convenience layer, you'd probably use
                  bootstrap and deploy to github pages, Heroku or AWS
                  S3.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I wanted to write at least one web-site the most
                  ancient way available, to see how much the browser can
                  do nowadays. So let's get started.

              <p>
                  The Blogs that I frequently read are more informative
                  and less design-focused. I wanted to follow that
                  strategy and compared some of my frequents:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com">randomascii</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://prideout.net">prideout.net</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://danluu.com">danluu.com</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://drewdevault.com">drewdevault.com</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">fabiensanglard.net</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                  Looks simple: a header with the name of the website, a
                  small navbar with links to "blog", "github" and
                  "about". The first one linked to the landing page itself
                  and then a list of articles, to get straight to the
                  point.
              </p>
              <p>
                  So let's make a plan:
                  <dl>
                      <dt>Site Structure</dt>
                      <dd>
                          I wanted to launch as fast as possible, so I
                          wouldn't get bored by the realities of
                          side-projects. If you don't finish a
                          side-project, it's as if you've never started
                          it. So the bare minimum of a blog contains a
                          landing page, an about page and at least one
                          article. Something like the diagram below. I
                          will even cheat and put my pdf CV up, so I
                          don't have to design a web page for my CV.
                      </dd>

                      <dt>Page Structure</dt>
                      <dd>Semantic Tags, Header, Footer, Impress</dd>

                      <dt>Responsiveness</dt>
                      <dd>Header, Article Roll</dd>

                      <dt>Typography</dt>
                      <dd>Fonts, Font Sizes</dd>

                      <dt>Styling</dt>
                      <dd>Header, Tagline, Article List, Source Code Listing</dd>
                  </dl>

              </p>
              
              
          </section>

          
      </main>
  </body>
