              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>
                  Hello Internet! This is the first entry of my blog. I
                  am a software engineer working for Siemens Technology
                  in Germany. I mostly work on IoT related projects in
                  different industrial branches like smart
                  infrastructure, manufacturing, energy, healthcare
                  etc. You can find out more about me on my
                  <a href="../about.html">about</a> page.
              </p>

              <p>
                  I mostly do backend stuff with golang in my
                  professional life and feel comfortable automating
                  stuff with Linux. Nowadays it's almost impossible to
                  evade web technology, as most desktop applications
                  have disappeared.
              </p>

              <p>
                  While the upper layers like JavaScript frameworks make
                  me run away, there is still a lot of interesting tech
                  involved, which I'd like to learn about. A great
                  colleague and web-wizard pointed me to
                  <a href="https://mzl.la/35lm3ts">Mozilla Web Docs</a>,
                  which struck me as one of the most beautifully written
                  piece of technical documentation ever conceived.
              </p>

              <p>
                  As nobody has ever learned anything, without getting
                  their hands dirty, I decided to hand-write HTML / CSS
                  for this blog, to see how far this approach can take
                  me (probably not that far, as the plethora of static
                  site generators, CSS frameworks and worry-free hosting
                  providers don't exist for nothing).
              </p>

              <h3>Domain and Web Server</h3>
              <p>
                  I reserved www.hadjian.com and www.hadjian.de ages ago
                  from a German hosting provider and never cared to put
                  something up. I was able to SSH into the server and
                  checked the settings of <code>sshd_config</code>. To
                  my surprise, all users including <code>root</code> were
                  allowed to login via password! Can you spell
                  d-i-c-t-i-o-n-a-r-y a-t-t-a-c-k?
              </p>
              <p>
                  Since this is the internet we're talking about, I
                  checked the frequency of login attempts by hackers or
                  script kiddies (see output below, snipped for sanity).

                  Who is <b>gary</b> and why was he trying to break into
                  my server? Luckily <code>lastb</code> shows
                  failed attempts. When I ran <code>last</code> it only
                  showed my own logins, although a good hacker would
                  have wiped that probably. So roughly 5-6 attempts per
                  minute. Hmmm...

                  </pre>
              </div>
              <p>
                  After updating all the packages, I modified <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf</code> to
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>dissallow root login,</li>
                  <li>only allow a specific group to login and</li>
                  <li>only allow key-based login / disabling password login</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                  Before that, I added my user to the login group,
                  created an SSH key with <code>ssh-keygen</code> on my
                  local machine and copied over the public key to
                  <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Then I restarted
                  <code>sshd</code>. Now I should be the only one being
                  able to login.
              </p>

                  Nothing worrying to my understanding, excpet maybe the
                  <code>xinted</code> and <code>saslauthd</code> daemons.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Why is that installed? <code>xinetd</code> is a
                  super-server, which invokes others, in case their port
                  is connected to. Trying to deinstall it should list
                  dependent packages and tell me, if there is something
                  I might need. It didn't list anything dependent, so I
                  deleted it.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <code>saslauthd</code> had some dependencies however,
                  which don't seem necessary for my purposes:

                  I was not going to use my webserver as a mailserver
                  and all of those packages have to do with mail. Also I
                  was going to use nginx instead of apache, so all of
                  that could go away, if it was installed. Now I have a
                  list of running processes, I am familiar with and
                  which are required for webserver operations.

                  SSH, nginx and named have ports open, which seems

              <h3>Hand-Crafted HTML/CSS</h3>
              <p>
                  Nowadays it probably doesn't make sense to run your
                  own server and hand-write HTML / CSS. We have medium,
                  worpress and similar things and even going one level
                  below the convenience layer, you'd probably use
                  bootstrap and deploy to github pages, Heroku or AWS
                  S3.

                  I wanted to write at least one web-site the most
                  ancient way available, to see how much the browser can
                  do nowadays. So let's get started.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Blogs that I frequently read are more informative
                  and less design-focused. I wanted to follow that
                  strategy and compared some of my frequents:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com">randomascii</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://prideout.net">prideout.net</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://danluu.com">danluu.com</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://drewdevault.com">drewdevault.com</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">fabiensanglard.net</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                  Looks simple: a header with the name of the website, a
                  small navbar with links to "blog", "github" and
                  "about". The main area will contain list of articles
                  previews, to get straight to the point.
              </p>
              <p>
                  So let's make a plan:
                  <dl>
                      <dt>Site Structure</dt>
                      <dd>
                          A landing page with a list of articles and
                          links to an "about"-page and my github
                          page. The landing page will display a list of
                          all articles. I will cheat and put my CV as
                          pdf behind the "about"-link. It is written in
                          LaTeX and I don't want to recreate it in HTML.
                      </dd>

                      <dt>Page Structure</dt>
                      <dd>
                          HTML5 introduced semantic tags, which are
                          quite well defined if you write a
                          text-document. So it was straigh-forward to
                          use them in the creation of a blog.

                          For the landing page, the <code>header</code>
                          contains the <code>title</code> and
                          <code>navbar</code>, while the <code>main</code>
                          area contains merely a list of <code>article</code>
                          elements like in the below figure.

                          <figure aria-labelledby="structure-caption">
                              <pre>

                          CSS has become a joy to work with. I remember
                          my first experiments a couple of years ago,
                          where centering was hard! Now it is
                          <code>margin: 0 auto;</code>
                          I wanted to display the title and the navbar
                          in one line, if there is enough space (see
                          responsiveness below). This was also easily done using
                          <code>display: flex</code>, aligning the links
                          to the right with <code>justify-content: flex-end;</code>
                          and exanding the title to take up the rest of
                          the space, so the text can be left-aligned,
                          while pushing the links to the right. This is
                          done with <code>flex: 1 auto;</code>. The result:
                          <figure>
                              <img alt="A screenshot of the header, 
                                        which contains the page title 
                                        and the navbar in one line."
                                   src="../images/responsive_small.png"/>
                          </figure>
                      </dd>

                      <dt>Responsiveness</dt>
                      <dd>
                          <a href="https://mzl.la/38uv99n">Normal Flow</a> will
                          already give me responsiveness for normal
                          text. Also the header will behave nicely, when
                          the browser is resized. However, if there is
                          not enough space for all of the text, the
                          title text will wrap with the following result:

                          <figure>
                              <img alt="Image displaying ugly wrapping of 
                                        the title text in the navbar, if there
                                        is not enough room for title and nav links."
                                   src="../images/responsive_no_wrap.png"/>
                          </figure>

                          This happens if either the font-size is
                          increased or the screen has not enough
                          horizontal width. There is an easy built-in
                          mitigation, by using <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>
                          on the navbar, which will allow the links to
                          wrap to the next line.

                          I will only add a tiny media query to center
                          the title and navbar horizontally, once they
                          display on two separate lines.

                          The clever thing I learned from MDN is to make
                          the query dependent on the number of charaters
                          with <code>39em</code>, as centering will also
                          happen if the text is zoomed and not only if
                          the page width falls below a certain number of
                          pixels. Final result:
                          
                          <figure>
                              <img alt="Image displaying the header with
                                         a centered title on one line and 
                                         centered nav links on the next."
                                   src="../images/responsive_wrap.png"/>
                          </figure>

                      </dd>
                  </dl>

                  <h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

                  <p>
                      As a beginner I wrote the CSS without a specific
                      approach, adding lines as I needed them. After the
                      site behaved as I wanted it to do, I ran over the CSS
                      once and deleted/rearranged to make it more
                      sensible. But that is probably all the love that file
                      will get. It was a hobby project anyways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I know that web-technology is quite forgiving, so
                      I ran my pages through validators to see how much
                      I got wrong on my first go. It wasn't all that bad:

                      <figure>
                          <img alt="Image displaying the three errors from 
                                    validating this blog entry."
                               src="../images/html_validation.png"/>
                      </figure>

                      After fixing those tiny errors, I would quickly
                      check how large my page size has become. I checked
                      this on the browser network tab by reloading the
                      page and as expected it was with 280 KiB quite
                      tiny, so no need for minifying anything.

                      Also I tried the worst throttling ("Slow 3G") and
                      the page loaded in 11.27 seconds. Great!                   
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3>Final Thoughts </h3>
                  <p>
                      The best thing about this project is, that I
                      finally have a blog, where I can do write-ups of
                      the projects I spend a lot of time on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I did understand lots from following the MDN
                      tutorials and now at least know what "normal
                      flow", "block elements" and "inline elements" are
                      and much much more, so I got my moneys worth of
                      education out of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      As always, if you really finish a small project,
                      it takes multiple the amount of time you'd thought
                      it would take, so even in private it is important
                      to scope any project to the bare minimum.
                  </p>
