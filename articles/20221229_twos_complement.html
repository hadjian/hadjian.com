              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                  I am in the progress of reading the excellent book
                  <a href="https://www.charlespetzold.com/books/">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a>. The
                  book walks you through the chronology of inventions
                  that made the computer possible. One chapter is
                  dedicated to number representation and arithmentic,
                  which is where the two's complement is naturally
                  explained.
              </p>
              <p>
                  This is where I realized that I knew the "how it
                  lkj works", but not the "why it works". The explanation in
                  the book didn't get through to me, either. As I had to
                  piece together the information and couldn't find a
                  source, which did the job for me, I decided to write
                  it down in this article.
              </p>
              <h3>What Problem are we solving?</h3>
              <p>
                  Imagine you already know how to build a machinery,
                  which can add two positive numbers. It doesn't matter
                  whether you use transistors, tubes, relays or
                  gears. Just something that "mechanically" takes two
                  positive numbers and outputs the result. Like this black box:

              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="black box adder" src="../images/black-box-adder.svg"/>              
              </p>
              <p>
                  To visualize the operation of an adder machinery, we
                  can look at the number line of whole numbers (natural
                  numbers plus 0). The first operand, which is "4" in
                  our example above, may be seen as the starting point
                  and the second operand, which is "3" in the same
                  example, may be seen as movement into the direction of
                  increasing numbers:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="addition on the number line" src="../images/addition-on-number-line.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Now the goal is to modify this machinary to enable
                  subtraction and not only addition. Using the two's
                  complement achieves this, by actually turning
                  subtraction into addition. How this works will be
                  explained in the remainder of this article.
              </p>              
              <h3>Wrapping Around</h3>
              <p>
                  In terms of our number line we can only move into the
                  direction of increasing numbers using our adder
                  machinery. Subtraction in this analogy is moving into
                  the opposite direction. Let's walk through the steps
                  to achieve this.
              </p>
              <p>
                  For this, observe a limitation of any real-world adder
                  machinery: the number of digits accepted as input and
                  produced as output are limited, because its a physical
                  thing, which cannot accept or output unbounded
                  values. In our simple example above this limit is one
                  digit. The numbers are represented in the decimal
                  system for now, so the digits 0-9 are accepted and
                  produced.
              </p>
              <p>
                  But even when adding two single digits, the result may
                  have two digits as in 8+3=11. But since the output was
                  wired to only have one digit, the result will be
                  8+3=1. The carry digit is simply discarded, because it
                  has no place to go. The machinery will signal this
                  overflow on a dedicated output.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="adder with discarded output" src="../images/adder-carry-discard.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  So if we keep adding one to our result and we cross 9,
                  we will in a sense wrap around to 0, then 1, then 2
                  etc. The key observation to make here now is that with
                  such a limitation, when we add 3 to 8 we arrive at the
                  same number as if we had subtracted 7 from 8. Let's
                  visualize this on our number line:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="addition with wrap-around on the number line" src="../images/wrap-around-number-line.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Now there seems to be a way to turn a subtraction into
                  an addition, which arrives at the same result. We need
                  to understand the systematic behind this observation,
                  to add it to our machinery.
              </p>
              <h3>The Method of Complements</h3>
              <p>
                  To make the wrap-around more apparent, We will turn
                  the line into a circle:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="a number circle" src="../images/complement-ring.svg"/>
              </p>              
              <p>
                  If you look at our circle above, we see that starting
                  at 8 and either adding 3 (the grey segment) or
                  subtracting 7 (the blueish segment) will both arrive
                  at 1 as its result. Both distances taken together
                  describe the full circle. This is no coincidence.
              </p>
              <p>
                  A full circle in our decimal system has 10 digits. So
                  if I want to reach the same number moving into either
                  direction, then the two distances sum up to 10. So I
                  either go 3 steps into the negative direction, or
                  10-3=7 into the positive direction. And this is where
                  the term <i>complement</i> stems from: I take the
                  complement to 10 to change direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                  This is the basic algorithm then:
                  <ol type="1">
                      <li>Check if we are adding or subtracting two numbers</li>
                      <li>If we add, just input the two numbers and you're done</li>
                      <li>If we subtract, complement the second operand to 10, then add</li>
                  </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                  And here is the adder extended with the <em>complementer</em> showing
                  a subtraction of <math>8-7=1</math> in action:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="an adder with a complementer" src="../images/adder-with-complement.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  In case we built our adder to accomodate for more
                  digits, let's say 3, then the wrap-around would happen
                  at 999 and our ring had 1000 representable numbers (0
                  to 999). Thus, we change direction by taking the
                  complement with respect to 1000 (10<sup>3</sup>).
              </p>
              <p>
                  Before we can pad ourselves on our shoulder, there is
                  one thing we need to fix: when we're subtracting, we
                  deliberately cross nine, which falsly triggers the
                  overflow signal like in the example above. It shouldn't.
              </p>
              <p>
                  And since we are subtracting, we will eventually run
                  into underflows, which actually should be singaled, as
                  in 4-6. If we follow through with our
                  algorithm above, we complement 6 to 10, yielding 4 and
                  than add it to the first operand: 4+4=8. The
                  result has no carry, so no underflow is signalled.
              </p>
              <p>
                  You may have noticed that our adder behaves exactly
                  oposing to our desired signaling behavior, so
                  inverting it's behavior will do the trick.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In the below diagrams, I added an inverter to the
                  overflow signal, which is only active when we're
                  subtracting. The diagrams show two cases: one with an
                  underflow and another which stays in range. I'll walk
                  you through it.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <div class="side-by-side">
                      <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/adder-underflow.svg"/>
                      <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/adder-no-underflow.svg"/>
                  </div>
              </p>
              <p>
                  The first diagram shows <math>4-6=8</math>, i.e. a
                  larger number subtractred from a smaller one. The
                  second operand 6 is complemented to 10 to result in 4
                  and the addition will have a carry of 0, which will be
                  inverted to 1, so an underflow is correctly signalled.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The second one shows 8-7=1, i.e. a
                  smaller number subtracted from a larger one. The
                  second operand 7 is complemented to 10 to result in 3,
                  resulting in 11. The carry will be discarded in the
                  output and inverted for the underflow signal,
                  resulting in no underflow. Nice!
              </p>
              <p>
                  Addition remains unchanged, as the complementer will
                  not complement and the over-/underflow signal will not
                  be inverted. Compare the following two additions, one
                  triggering an overflow and the other that stays in
                  range:
              </p>
              <p>

              <h3>The Complementer</h3>
              <p>
                  We need to talk about the complementer. I admit that I
                  fooled you a bit: the complementer subtracts the
                  operand from 10, so we actually need a subtractor!
                  Sorry I wasn't honest.
              </p>
              <p>
                  But my betrayal wasn't that bad. At least we only need
                  to subtract from a fixed number, which is 10<sup>n</sup>,
                  with n being the number of digits. Still, high-school
                  subtraction will involve borrowing a one from the next
                  digit, if the digit we are subtracting (the
                  subtrahend) is bigger than the one being subtracted
                  from (the minuend).
              </p>
              <p>
                  We can do at least one easier with a trick: if we
                  don't subtract from 10<sup>n</sup>, but from
                  10<sup>n</sup>-1 and add the missing one back at the
                  end, the result will stay the same, but the complement
                  is taken to a series of nines. No borrows involved
                  anymore. An example for complementing with 1000:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <center>
                      1000-1-777+1=333
                  </center>
                  is equivalent to
                  <center>
                      999-777+1=333
                  </center>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Now we can at least regard each pair of digits in
                  isolation and just deal with the problem of
                  subtracting from 9, as 9 is always larger or equally
                  large as any other digit we are subtracting from
                  it. Once we get to binary, this trick will resolve all
                  our problems, so keep it in mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                  A note on notation that drove me mad. In the
                  literature I studied, the complement to
                  10<sup>n</sup> is called the <em>ten's complement</em>. The
                  complement to ten minus one is called the <em>nines' complement</em>.
                  It drove me crazy, because the <em>nines' complement</em> is
                  just a series of nines, but not 9<sup>n</sup>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  What I didn't see for a long time was the position of
                  the apostrophe. The complement to 10<sup>n</sup> is the
                  <math>ten's complement</math> (genitive), so the
                  complement of ten. The <math>nines' complement</math> (plural)
                  is the complement to a series of nines.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I call that bad word usability.
              </p>
              <h3>Signed Numbers</h3>
              <p>
                  Our little machine can now subtract positive numbers
                  by complementing one operand, but we can use the
                  complement also to represent negative numbers.

                  We wanted to move from 8 to 1. Not being able to move
                  7 steps into the negative direction, we moved 3 into
                  the positive, because its effect was the same.
              </p>
              <p>
                  So the numbers -7 and 3 behave the same under
                  addition. As do all the others when complemented to
                  10. So we might as well regard each number as its
                  negative complemented partner:
              </p>

                  <img class="diagram" alt="number circle with respective negative numbers" src="../images/number-circle-10-complement.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  An explanation of why this works and why I sneakily left
                  out the complement to zero is in order.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Firstly, the ten's complement (mind the genivite ;-)
                  of zero is 10. As we only keep one digit it will fall
                  back to zero. This is deemed as one of the advantages
                  of this method: 0 and -0 have the same
                  representation. No wasted digits.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Secondly, let's take another look at our
                  adder/subtractor machinery, which we painstainkingly
                  designed until now and see how it subtracts the
                  positive numbers 3 from 4:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/adder-no-underflow.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Remember? We assert the subtraction signal to
                  complement the 3, so instead of going back 3 steps in
                  our number circle, we go forward 7 steps, arriving at
                  1. It wouldn't be any different, if we input 7
                  directly and didn't assert the subtraction signal:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/adder-signed.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  So in short: 4-3 is the same as 4+7. I hope it makes
                  sense now that we could also say: 4-3 is the same as
                  4+(-3), reinterpreting the 7 as (-3). Only that pesky
                  over-/underflow signal is acting up again. We'll fix
                  that in a second.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We gained the power of expressing negative numbers. In
                  fact, we can just choose any number of digits to be
                  their negative counterparts. Let's pick the digits 4
                  to 9 to actually mean -6 to -1. I purposely picked an
                  uneven number of digits to be interpreted as negative,
                  because most literature will tell you to cut the set
                  of digits in half and interpret one half to be
                  negative. This approach has benefits in binary as we
                  will see, but it is by no means mandatory to get the
                  complement method to work:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/number-circle-10-signed.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Let's test this new interpretation for a subtraction
                  that stays in range: 1+(-4)=-3. So the first operand
                  is 1, the second is the ten's complement to 4, which
                  is 6. But we won't use our complementer, but input the
                  6 ourselves and we don't assert the subtraction
                  signal, as we are adding a negative number:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/adder-signed-negative-result.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Effectively we move 6 steps into the positive
                  direction, which is the same as moving 4 steps into
                  the negative direction. The result is 7. Looking at
                  our number circle above, 7 is interpreted as -3, so
                  1+(-4)=-3. Bingo.
              </p>
              <p>
                  As promised, we need to fix our over-/underflow
                  signal, because the machinery will still signal an
                  overflow for crossing the 0 from the negative
                  direction, e.g. for -2+3=1 (where instead of -2 we
                  would use 8).
              </p>
              <p>
                  It turns out that there is no elegant solution in our
                  decimal system. We would really have to look at it case by case:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>                      
                          <b>A positive number added to a positive number:</b>
                          If we started at 0, 1, 2 or 3 and added a positive
                          number, but ended up at 4 (-6), 5 (-5) ..., then we
                          overflowed
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          <b>A negative number added to a negative number:</b>
                          If we started at one of the negative numbers
                          and added a negative number or subtracted a
                          positive one, but ended up positive, we
                          underflowed
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <b>A negative number added to a positive or vice versa:</b>
                          This combination can never over- or
                          underflow. Just check out the number circle
                          and try it.
                      </li>
                  </ol>                      
              </p>
              <p>
                  I know that it is hard to imagine how to put this
                  logic into our machinery, but as with our complementer
                  I have to ask for your patience, because in binary it
                  will be trivial to implement.
              </p>
              <h3>What we've learned so far</h3>
              <p>
                  The good news is that you now know every trick there
                  is to know to understand why the complement method
                  works. In the remainder of this article we will merely
                  transfer this knowledge to the binary system. We will
                  do this by first generalizing to arbitrary number
                  bases and then go to binary. But first we sum up what
                  we now know:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          The fixed width digits make the adder wrap-around
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Thus instead of subtracting, we can add the complement to come around from the other side
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          When we subtract, we deliberately overflow, so we invert the overflow signal
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          The complementer is still subtraction, but a bit easier when we subtract from 10<sup>n</sup>-1. Will become trivial in binary
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          We can input the complement of numbers
                          directly, interpreting the complements as
                          negative numbers, e.g. 1+(-3)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          The over- and underflow need to be checked with a weird if/else statement, which again becomes trivial in binary
                      </li>
                  </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Ok, now for some math to generalize this knowledge to arbitary bases.
              </p>
              <h3>The (diminished) Radix Complement</h3>
              <p>
                  As you may know, 10 is the radix of our decimal
                  system, which means we have 10 uniqe digits. The
                  complement method works with any radix of any number
                  system, giving this method it's name <em>the radix complement</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In general we can formalize the radix complement as
                  follows :
              </p>
              <p>
                  <center>
                      a<sub>c</sub> = b<sup>n</sup>-a,
                  </center>
              </p>
              <p>
                  where a<sub>c</sub> is the complement to a, b is the
                  radix or base of the number system and n is the number
                  of digits to which we constrain our machinery to.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We also need the complement to the radix minus one,
                  which is called the <em> dimminished radix complement </em>:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <center>
                      a<sub>dc</sub> = b<sup>n</sup>-1-a,
                  </center>                      
              </p>
              <p>
                  where a<sub>dc</sub> is the dimminished radix
                  complement to a, while the rest has the same
                  definition as above. And from the formulas above it is
                  easy to see that the radix complement equals the
                  diminished radix complement plus one.
              </p>
              <p>
                  One property that also translates to the generalized
                  case is that the number we subtract from in the
                  diminished radix complement is always a series of the
                  digit with the highest value in the number system at
                  hand, e.g. 999 in decimal or 444 in quinary or 111 in
                  binary.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Let's translate this knowledge to the <i>quinary system</i>,
                  which has base 5. A quick recap on numbering systems:
                  if we have n digits to our disposal, we count up until
                  we run out of digits, after which we will add a carry
                  to the next position and start from zero again. The
                  quinary system on a number line thus looks like this:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/quinary-number-line.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  where 10 is not the number of fingers on our hands,
                  but the number of stars a very good hotel has. We
                  just don't have this nice symbol 5 in our quinary
                  system to express it, so we're using a combination of
                  the symbols we have to our disposal.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The diagram below shows the number circle for one quinary digit:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="a number circle for the quinary system" src="../images/complement-ring-5.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  If we take the example of 2-1=1 and consider our
                  formula above, we can achieve the same result by
                  taking the five's complement of 1, which is 4. It
                  follows that 2+4=11 (look at our number line above, if
                  you don't belive me). Now we discard the second 1 and
                  arrive at the correct result of 1. We just exercised
                  2+(-1)=1 in quinary.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The complement method works. What about the overflow
                  suppression? Nothing special in quinary, just invert
                  the carry again, if we are subtracting.
              </p>
              <p>
                  What about signed numbers? Still works! Let's do a
                  quick reinterpretation:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/number-circle-5-signed.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  and test it against 1+(-2). -2 becomes 5-2=3, so
                  instead of going two steps negative, we go 3 steps
                  positive and arrive at 4, which we interpret as
                  -1. 1+(-2)=-1 checks out.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Also in quinary we need subtraction for our
                  complementer module. And also here we can avoid
                  borrows and at least concern ourselves with each digit
                  in isolation, if we complement to the dimished radix,
                  which is 5-1=4 or 5<sup>3</sup>-1=444, when dealing
                  with three digits.
              </p>
              <p>
                  As I said, the dimished radix is always a series of
                  digits with the highest value. Think about it: in any
                  number system, the base itself is always a 1 followed
                  by zeros (like 5 on the number line above is written
                  as 10). 6 in the senary number system (base 6) is also
                  10. So it should be clear that if we subtract one from
                  10 or 100 or 1000 etc. that the result will be a
                  series of the digits with the highest value (100-1=99
                  in decimal, 100-1=44 in quinary etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                  And like in the decimal case with signed numbers, we
                  don't care about crossing zero anymore when trying to
                  detect over- and underflows. Also in quinary, the
                  logic is still weird. We need to check all cases. As
                  promised, this will resolve in binary.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Finally we can go to binary and the two's complement,
                  which should be a piece of cake as we already know
                  everything there is to know and the two remaining
                  mysteries (complementer and over-/underflow detection)
                  will take care of itself in binary.
              </p>
              <h3>The Two's Complement</h3>
              <p>
                  We seem to have established a certain procedure, so
                  let's stick to it. First the binary system on a number
                  line, but instead of allowing only one digit, we exand
                  to three. Otherwise we'd already wrap-around after two
                  digits, which looks stupid:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/binary-number-line.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Again, we can display the line as a circle to make the
                  wrap-around more obvious:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/number-circle-binary.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                 By now, we are experts in changing direction to express
                 subtraction as addition. And we also can use fancy
                 mathematical terms for this act: if we want to execute
                 the subtraction 011-010=001, we turn it into 011+(-010)
                 by taking the radix complement in binary, i.e. the
                 two's complement, from 010:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <center>
                      2<sup>3</sup>-010
                  </center>
                  expressed in the binary system will become
                  <center>
                      10 <sup>3</sup>-010
                  </center>
                  is equivalent to
                  <center>
                      1000-010=110
                  </center>
              </p>
              <p>
                  This results in 011+110=1001. Cross out the leading one
                  because of our constraint to only support three digits
                  and we see that it works.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I promised that complementing in binary will become
                  trivial to implement in hardware, so here it goes: I
                  asked you to remember the diminished radix complement,
                  which was
              </p>
              <p>
                  <center>
                      a<sub>c</sub>=b<sup>n</sup>-1-a,
                  </center>
              </p>
              <p>
                  which will always lead to a series of the numeral with
                  the highest value in the respective number system. So
                  in binary for three digits, the diminished radix
                  complement looks as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <center>
                      a<sub>c</sub>=10<sup>3</sup>-1-a,
                  </center>
                  which is equivalent to
                  <center>
                      a<sub>c</sub>=1000-1-a,
                  </center>
                  which is equivalent to
                  <center>
                      a<sub>c</sub>=111-a.
                  </center>
              </p>
              <p>
                  So in binary the dimished radix complement is taken
                  with respect to a series of ones and thus called the
                  ones' complement (mind the stupid apostrophe).
              </p>
              <p>
                  Subtracting any binary number from a series of ones is
                  just flipping all the bits from the subtrahend,
                  e.g. 111-010=101 or 111-001=110. It shouldn't be too
                  hard to imagine that it is easy to implement a
                  bit-flipper in hardware. For those who forgot their
                  digital logic class, it's the behavior of a XOR gate,
                  when one input is asserted.
              </p>
              <p>
                  There you go! To change directions in the number
                  circle, we take the two's complement, which is easily
                  done by first taking the ones' complement (flipping
                  all the bits) and then adding the one back. The adder
                  now looks as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/adder-binary-complement.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  That's it for unsigned numbers. We also already
                  suppressed the overflow signal, when deliberately
                  crossing zero on subtraction.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The last and final step is to reinterpret a set of
                  binary numbers as being negative numbers. But before
                  we write the negative numbers to the circle, let's
                  take another look at the unmodified circle with
                  unsigned numbers:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/number-circle-binary.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Remember the second problem I promised would dissolve
                  in binary? When reinterpreting a set of numbers as
                  negative, we had this weird logic to check if we went
                  from positive to negative numbers etc. That logic was
                  weird, because it was not obvious how to detect if we
                  passed our imaginary over- or underflow threshold.
              </p>
              <p>
                  But in binary, as you can verify above, this becomes
                  easy if we interpret all numbers with a leading one as
                  negative and those with a leading zero as
                  positive. Then we can use the leading bit to check, if
                  two positive numbers were added and resulted in a
                  negative.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Ok, remember we will now reinterpret all values with a
                  leading one to a negative number, but it is just
                  reinterpretation, so the actual values that go into
                  the adder as operands are the ones from the above
                  circle. Here we go:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <img class="diagram" alt="" src="../images/number-circle-signed-binary.svg"/>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Now the over-/underflow happens when stepping from 011
                  to 100 (-100) or from 100 (-100) to 011. Let's
                  reiterate our conditions for over-/underflow
                  detection:
              </p>
              <p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>                      
                          <b>A positive number added to a positive number:</b>
                          if the leading bits of both operands are zero
                          and the result it one, then we
                          overflowed. This is easy to implement as a
                          logic expression and thus as a logic circuit.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <b>A negative number added to a negative number:</b>
                          If both leading bits are one and the leading
                          bit of the result is zero, we underflowed.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <b>A negative number added to a positive or vice versa:</b>
                          This combination can never over- or
                          underflow. Just check out the number circle
                          and try it.
                      </li>
                  </ol>                                        
              </p>
              <p>
                  And we're done. I never thought that such an everyday
                  seemingly simple concept would take me so long to
                  write about. This was really a surprise, but I am
                  happy I made it this far.
